Timeline web app

---
T-Plot is a web app which users can use to create and store Timelines as a list of events.  It has been created to demonstrate how to use the web framework Django and deploy it on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk.  While many project features are still being implemented but the project has a fully functioning CI/CD pipeline which deploys the project on AWS.


The current release up and running [here](https://tplot.lukegregorydev.co.uk).

---
## Implemented Features
  - Django Web App
  - User registration, login and logout.
  - Create, Read, Update and Delete information in a Postgres database running on AWS RDS.
  - Permissions to ensure users can only view their database records.
  - High availability using AWS EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group with a Load Balancer.

## Project Road Map
  - Scaled PDF timelines created from userâ€™s data
  - User guides and documentation
  - Use AWS S3 to allow users to store images with their timelines
  - Sharing and collaboration
  - Register with Google, Github etc
  - Implement timelines with different unit types
    - Data & Time
    - Years BC to AD
    - Thousands/Millions/Billions of years in the past and future

## CI/CD

This project uses 3 workflows which showcase some of the possibilities if GitHub Actions.
  - Manually triggered workflow to create or terminate the Elastic Beanstalk production environment.
    - [Elastic Beanstalk Environment](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/blob/main/.github/workflows/ebs_environment.yaml)
  - Reusable workflow to test if the production environment is up and running.
    - [Elastic Beanstalk Environment Status](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/blob/main/.github/workflows/ebs_environment_status.yaml)
  - Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment pipeline that tests the code before integrating it with the main branch.  Then it will deploy to the production environment if it is running.
    - [CI/CD](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml)
  - Automated setup and terminate of access through AWS Route53 and HTTPS using Boto3.
    - [Setup Https](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/tree/main/python_scripts/awseb_https)
    - [Delete Route53 Alias Record](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/tree/main/python_scripts/delete_alias)
    - [Delete ACM Certificate](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/tree/main/python_scripts/delete_certificate)
