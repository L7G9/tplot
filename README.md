Timeline web app

---
T-Plot is a web app which can be used to create timelines as a list of events, these are used to create a perfectly scaled PDF of the timeline.
The user sets the scale and layout settings they want, and the app automatically handles the correct positioning of the events on PDF.
Created to demonstrate the use of the web framework Django, it features a fully functional CI/CD pipeline that deploys it on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

The current release up and running [here](https://tplot.lukegregorydev.co.uk).

## CI/CD

This project uses 3 workflows which showcase some of the possibilities if GitHub Actions.
  - Manually triggered workflow to create or terminate the Elastic Beanstalk production environment.
    - [Elastic Beanstalk Environment](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/blob/main/.github/workflows/ebs_environment.yaml)
  - Reusable workflow to test if the production environment is up and running.
    - [Elastic Beanstalk Environment Status](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/blob/main/.github/workflows/ebs_environment_status.yaml)
  - Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment pipeline that tests the code before integrating it with the main branch.  Then it will deploy to the production environment if it is running.
    - [CI/CD](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml)
  - Automated setup and terminate of access through AWS Route53 and HTTPS using Boto3.
    - [Setup Https](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/tree/main/python_scripts/awseb_https)
    - [Delete Route53 Alias Record](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/tree/main/python_scripts/delete_alias)
    - [Delete ACM Certificate](https://github.com/L7G9/tplot/tree/main/python_scripts/delete_certificate)
